## Key Features of the App
- Calendar View with Google Calendar and Zoom integration:
  - Create, delete, and edit events.
  - You can create recurring events.
  - All attendees must be clients prior to creating a meeting. This prevents us from creating events without having the appropriate client information.
  - Events created in the app are automatically added to my Google Calendar.
  - All attendees receive an email with an invitation to the event.
  - Deleting an event removes it from the Google Calendar and also notifies attendees of the cancellation.
  - You can also generate Zoom meeting links for events.
  - When an event with a Zoom link is deleted, the associated Zoom meeting is also removed automatically.
- Client List: Add, edit, and delete clients.
- Student List: Add, edit, and delete students.
